# UnityGames

This git repo contains mini games that I have created in my own time as experiments or for fun.

## Games

### LemonClicker

A take on the basic clicker game, story/purpose is still in progress but basically will be a simple take on a basic clicker game.


## Ideas
Game ideas I have in the future

- Battleships: a revisit to a super basic java game I made in summer of ~2013

*Note*
I'm not good at naming projects hence everything is prefixed with lemon
